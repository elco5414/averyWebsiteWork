# welcome to my personal website
- this is my first real attempt using html and css, in order to create a personal portfolio website
- this website will be used to highlight my work and create a presence to showcase skills and projects
- it is also the best project for learning and continuing to learn html, and other web building languages and skills because it is something I will continue to work on and update throughout my career!
