<h1>Hello Elaina, welcome to this LEAD 4000 page ! </h1>

    <section class="reflection questions">
    <h2>Reflecton of the concepts one has learned and skills one has gained via the course works and key experiences at CU Boulder</h2>
    <p> The leadership studies minor at CU Boulder has been a wonderful learning experience. Through courses taken from freshmen to junior year of school I have gotten the immense privilege of learning about differing leadership styles, leadership from a global perspective, and the experience of real-life leadership applications. A particularly influential class to me was the Applied Learning Experience, which was not a class at all in the traditional sense. These credits were earned through working for Presidential Leadership Classes Student Staff, which taught me invaluable skills, more so than I have typically found in classrooms. </p>

    <h2>Craft a leadership mission statement and articulate one’s leadership vision</h2>
    <p>To lead through example is the most effective way in which I have seen leadership carried forth effectively. It is my vision for myself to be someone that others feel comfortable with, inspired by, and can rely upon. I want to live in a manner that reflects my values through my actions and encourages NOT pushes others to do the same. </p>

    <h2> Identify five key takeaways that have contributed to one’s understanding of leadership/ "aha" moments.</h2>
   <ul>
    1. My manager Reese at Steak Escape in highschool and the way that he lead.
   </ul>
   <ul>
    2. Women that I have worked/been in school with. 
   </ul>
   <ul>
    3. My parents, and religious background in the sense of how not leading by example is so impactful.
   </ul>
   <ul>
    4. Being an eldest sister. 
   </ul>
   <ul>
    5. My technical manager Andrew this summer, and the way in which he lead as well. 
   </ul>

    <h2> Demonstrate the ways in which one has applied/integrated course content into one’s various leadership endeavors. </h2>
    <p>Throughout these years at the University of Colorado Boulder earning this Leadership Studies minor, I have learned various applicable lessons that have shaped both my personal leadership philosophy which has been detailed above as well as my personal leadership praxis or actions. As stated before my philosophy on leadership is that example is the most effective way to inspire and encourage others to a common goal. This philosophy has been shaped by a lifetime of experiences but has been thoroughly strengthened by lessons learned in coursework here. In my introductory leadership courses, I sometimes recall a specific video in which someone was dancing out in public. At first, there was a crowd of people just watching that person, but once a second person got up and began to dance with them, so did an array of others from the crowd. This always reminded me of the power of example, and how your actions as an individual can lead others and sway a group whether you intend to or not. This lesson was also honed in through real experiences. Serving on student staff for the Presidential Leadership Class, I always felt more inspired about my job and helping PLC as a program when those in authority positions over me, or those surrounding me on staff were passionate about the program. For example, grumpily arriving at weekly 8 am meetings is never fun, but seeing that everyone else is there and has a decent attitude encourages you to suck it up and try to do the same. This is also something I experienced in the opposite direction where having someone in leadership who is not inspiring can lead you to be discouraged. This stood out strongly to me because it was not an effect of anyone’s actions, but rather people’s attitudes and how that can trickle down and affect those below and around them. It is a strong reminder that as a leader both your actions and attitude serve as an example to those around you, and you should be mindful of that. </p>
    <p>
      As for leadership praxis (I had to google what praxis meant for this) or actions that I have taken as a result of this leadership philosophy that has now been more clearly defined throughout years of school work and learning, I find that I try to implement leadership by example. Currently, the main extracurricular in which I hold a leadership position and actively put leadership skills into practice is for CU Women in Computing (WIC). I currently serve as treasurer for this club, which means that alongside our lovely and wonderful president, the two of us take care of essentially everything. I want to state from the get-go that every day I learn more and more about leadership as I continue to face new challenges and obstacles. I do try though especially in relation to engagement with members to lead through example. If I want people to talk to each other more at meetings, I try to speak to as many new people as I can during meetings. If I want people to be excited and actively engaged in the club, I try very hard to be actively excited and engaged in the club. If I want more people to serve on the board and take leadership roles, I try to do the same and ease that workload. These may seem to be small and insignificant things, yet I find that they do change the atmosphere and results of meetings. I also find that things as small as even friendships can be applied to this, or really any personal relationship. If you are in a group and you are the one who tries to be inclusive of everyone and make everyone feel comfortable and welcomed, it often leads others to do the same and sort of solidifies that dynamic amongst yall. If I am talking to my little brothers and trying to convince them to work hard, or to make sure that the people around them are kind and treat them well, I find that this holds more ground and has more meaning if it is what you are actively doing in your own life and it is working.

    <h2>Now What?</h2>
    <p>This minor has been a transformative learning experience that has offered valuable insights and knowledge. Still, anything learned needs to be retained and then applied by putting it into practice. I spoke a little about a current activity of a club in which I try to put coursework into practice, but this can be elaborated upon in a more broad and long-lasting sense. </p>
    <p>One thing that has stood out strongly to me is the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”. Although I could not pinpoint its origins I have heard it countless times throughout my life, and it is incredibly applicable to leadership in concept and especially in practice. Empathy is of the utmost importance when trying to be a good human, and when trying to be a good leader. Others will follow the lead you give, and the actions you put into practice towards others are the actions that they will go forth with, or return towards you. </p>
    <p>Another quote that resonates with this message is this, “We are part of this universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us.” - Neil Degrassi Tyson. It really highlights in my mind how we are part of something larger then ourselves, but it also resides in us, therefore, if there is change we want to see on a large scale, we do in fact have that power and ability within ourselves. This is I believe something that must be kept in mind when dealing with leadership or anything that can challenge us. </p>
