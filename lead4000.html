<h1>Hello Elaina, welcome to this lead 4000 page ! </h1>

    <section class="reflection questions">
    <h2>Reflecton of the concepts one has learned and skills one has gained via the course works and key experiences at CU Boulder</h2>
    <p> The leadership studies minor at CU Boulder has been a wonderful learning experience. Through courses taken from freshmen to junior year of school I have gotten the immense privilege of learning about differing leadership styles, leadership from a global perspective, and the experience of real-life leadership applications. A particularly influential class to me was the Applied Learning Experience, which was not a class at all in the traditional sense. These credits were earned through working for Presidential Leadership Classes Student Staff, which taught me invaluable skills, more so than I have typically found in classrooms. </p>

    <h2>Craft a leadership mission statement and articulate one’s leadership vision</h2>
    <p>To lead through example is the most effective way in which I have seen leadership carried forth effectively. It is my vision for myself to be someone that others feel comfortable with, inspired by, and can rely upon. I want to live in a manner that reflects my values through my actions and encourages NOT pushes others to do the same. </p>

    <h2> Identify five key takeaways that have contributed to one’s understanding of leadership/ "aha" moments.</h2>
   <ul>
    1. My manager Reese at Steak Escape in highschool and the way that he lead.
   </ul>
   <ul>
    2. Women that I have worked/been in school with. 
   </ul>
   <ul>
    3. My parents, and religious background in the sense of how not leading by example is so impactful.
   </ul>
   <ul>
    4. Being an eldest sister. 
   </ul>
   <ul>
    5.  My technical manager Andrew this summer. 
   </ul>

    <h2> Demonstrate the ways in which one has applied/integrated course content into one’s various leadership endeavors. </h2>
    <p> two ~300-word essays: one focused on your leadership philosophy and one focused on your leadership praxis</p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Now What?</h2>
    <p>Articulate the ways in which you will continue to be a student of leadership beyond the Leadership Studies Minor. (How will you adapt, respond, evolve, or remain flexible in light of multiple leadership perspectives, organizational commitments, or institutional requirements that you may encounter?  How might you continue to explore identified wicked problems regardless of your professional sector?)   
      Incorporate a minimum of three citations in the paper.  At least one citation should come from a source outside of LEAD 4000 (e.g., LEAD 1000 or equivalent, elective course, other relevant leadership material).  </p>
